The approach taken

First I chose the API to use - api.nasa.gov.
Then I built an MVC structure of my repository.
Then I set up my database.
Next step was setting up CRUD.
Then I seeded my database with some information from API.
Then I worked on CSS.
Next step - I added npm package currency-exchange.
Lastly, I deployed my app to Heroku.
